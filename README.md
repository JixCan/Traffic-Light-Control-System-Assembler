# Traffic light control system
#### A simple three-color traffic light control system with day and night modes.

The system allows you to control a conventional three-color LED traffic light. Two modes are available:
- **day mode**, which includes in order the following color combinations: red (5 seconds), red and yellow (3 seconds), green (2 seconds), green blinking (3 seconds);
- **night mode**, turning the yellow color on and off (every 0.5 seconds).

The system was developed in assembly language for the **ATMega328P** microcontroller.
